    ///   - `project_type`
    ///   - `categories` (loaders are lumped in with categories in search)
    ///   - `versions`
    ///   - `client_side`

    ///   - `open_source`
    ///
    /// Several others are also available for use, though these should not be used outside very specific use cases.

    ///   - `title`
    ///   - `author`
    ///   - `follows`
    ///   - `project_id`
    ///   - `license`
    ///   - `downloads`

    ///   - `modified_timestamp`
    ///
    /// In order to then use these facets, you need a value to filter by, as well as an operation to perform on this value. The most common operation is : (same as =), though you can also use !=, >=, >, <=, and <. Join together the type, operation, and value, and you've got your string.

    /// - `categories = adventure`

    /// ### OR
    ///

    /// For example, the search `[["versions:1.16.5", "versions:1.17.1"]]` translates to *Projects that support 1.16.5 OR 1.17.1.*

    /// Separate arrays are considered to be joined by AND statements.
